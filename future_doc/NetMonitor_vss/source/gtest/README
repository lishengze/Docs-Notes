Google C++ Testing Framework
============================

http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

Overview
--------

Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms
(Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, Symbian, etc).  Based on the
xUnit architecture.  Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set of
assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal
failures, various options for running the tests, and XML test report
generation.

Please see the project page above for more information as well as the
mailing list for questions, discussions, and development.  There is
also an IRC channel on OFTC (irc.oftc.net) #gtest available.  Please
join us!

Requirements for End Users
--------------------------

Google Test is designed to have fairly minimal requirements to build
and use with your projects, but there are some.  Currently, we support
Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and Cygwin.  We will also make our best
effort to support other platforms (e.g. Solaris, AIX, and z/OS).
However, since core members of the Google Test project have no access
to these platforms, Google Test may have outstanding issues there.  If
you notice any problems on your platform, please notify
googletestframework@googlegroups.com.  Patches for fixing them are
even more welcome!
